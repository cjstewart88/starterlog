# Intro

The purpose of this project is to provide a starting point for simple typescript/html projects.

# Getting Started

This assumes you have Node.js.

1. Clone this repo
2. Copy the following files into a new project's directory:
  ```
  src
  index.html
  package.json
  tsconfig.json
  ```
3. `cd` to your new project
4. `npm install` to install dependencies
5. `npm start`:
    - starts a tiny http server
    - compiles changes to your typescript files into javascript files so the browser can interpret them
6.  Navigate to http://localhost:8080/
