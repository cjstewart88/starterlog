# Intro

The purpose of this project is to provide a starting point for simple typescript/html projects.

# Getting Started

This assumes you have:
1. Node.js
2. A simple local web server that can serve a static `index.html` file

If you have the above follow these steps:
1. Clone this repo
2. Copy the following files into a new project's directory:
  ```
  src
  index.html
  package.json
  tsconfig.json
  ```
3. `cd` to your new project
4. `npm install`
5. `npm start`: At this point your typescript files will be compiling on save.
6.  Using a simple local web sever that's pointed at `index.html`, navigate to your application.
